"description":"A video camera is the centerpiece of your filmmaking gear package. What camera you choose depends on your budget, the type of shooting you're doing (static, stealth, run-and-gun, etc.) and where you plan to showcase your film (web-only, theater, broadcast, etc). You can shoot a documentary on anything from your iPhone to a DSLR to a top of line digital cinema camera such as the RED. Whatever camera you choose, make sure you capture excellent audio. "

"description":"The manlift was created to transport workers between floors of buildings under construction. Typically, manlifts are equipped with four wheels, and most can maneuver around sites. However, these machines are sometimes stationary and have to be moved on a trailer.Manlifts utilize a bent crane system that uses hydraulic pumps to raise a bucket that workers stand-in during transport. This construction lift is ideal for any project that needs to reach high elevations."
},

{
"name":"Boom Lift",
"picture":"https://acropolis-wp-content-uploads.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/boom-lift.jpg",
"description": "A boom lift is a type of aerial platform used to get workers off the ground to work on an elevated project. This construction lift has a bucket that’s typically large enough for one to two workers to stand in. Wheels or a continuous band of treads are used to make the machine mobile. The crane that lifts the bucket is operated by a hydraulic lift system.There are two main types of boom lifts, articulating and telescopic, but these are all part of the larger “construction lift” family."

In front of the operating cabin, there’s a mechanism that allows for the attachment of different types of tools.From buckets to loaders, a skid loader can host different equipment and is also small enough to maneuver into tight areas of a site. The frame is rigid, meaning turning is done through differential steering (e.g., each wheel moves at a different speed, thus causing a turn)."

  "picture":"https//acropolis-wp-content-uploads.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/cold-planer.jpg",
  "description":"A cold planer grinds asphalt, removing it from its original location. This machine drives down a space and picks up laid asphalt, mills it and then shoots it out a belt system into a dump truck.These machines help get a surface ready for new asphalt and aid in the recycling efforts by recovering old asphalt. This machine is bulky and hard to maneuver, so it’s essential to get the machine’s placement right when starting a job to ensure minimal shifting while milling."

  "picture": "https//acropolis-wp-content-uploads.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/compact-track-loader.jpg", 
  "description":"A compact track loader (CTL) and multi-terrain loader (MLT) are small, compressed machines used to transport and load materials. Equipped with front metal plate scoops, both machines lift and break apart massive loads.The difference between a CTL and an MTL is that a CTL is more rugged and puts immense pressure on the ground it’s on, so it’s best for tough terrain. The MTL is less rugged but is designed to work on more delicate surfaces."
